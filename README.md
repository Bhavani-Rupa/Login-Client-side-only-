# Login Project (Simple Explanation)

This small project shows a basic "Create Account" page that runs in your web browser. There is no server or database. It is meant for learning and demos only.

## What you can do

- Create an example account using a form
- See helpful messages if something is missing or incorrect
- See how strong your password is while typing
- Click social buttons (they only show demo messages)

## What this uses

- HTML (the content on the page)
- CSS (the page design and colors)
- JavaScript (makes things interactive)

## How to open it

You do not need to install anything.

1. Download or copy the project to your computer
2. Open the file named `index.html` in any web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)

Tip: You can double-click `index.html` to open it.

## What the files are

- `index.html`: The main page you see. It contains the form and buttons.
- `styles.css`: Makes the page look nice (colors, sizes, spacing).
- `script.js`: Adds behavior (checks the form, shows messages, etc.).
- `README.md`: This explanation.

## Important notes

- This is a demo. It does not save your data anywhere.
- There is no real login or signup. The messages are for practice only.
